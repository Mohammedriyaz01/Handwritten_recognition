Handwritten Recognition Project

Introduction

This project focuses on recognizing handwritten characters or digits using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It aims to develop an accurate and efficient system for identifying handwritten text from images.

Features

Handwritten text recognition

Preprocessing of images (grayscale conversion, noise reduction, etc.)

Training models using machine learning and deep learning

Deployment-ready API for real-world usage

Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

OpenCV

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Flask / FastAPI (for deployment)

Dataset

The project uses standard datasets such as:

MNIST (for digit recognition)

IAM Handwriting Dataset (for handwritten text recognition)

Custom dataset (if applicable)

Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository
git clone[
](https://github.com/Mohammedriyaz01/Handwritten_recognition.git)
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Prepare your dataset by placing images in the data directory.

Run the preprocessing script:

python preprocess.py

Train the model:

python train.py

Evaluate the model:

python evaluate.py

Deploy the model using Flask/FastAPI:

python app.py

Model Training

The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image recognition.

Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve generalization.

Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

API Endpoints

POST /predict - Accepts an image and returns the recognized text.

GET /status - Returns the status of the API.
